This repository has 24 ARIMA and ARIMAX models which forecasts Influenza Hospitalizations in 48 states of the U.S. 

########################################################################################

Our main folder has a Rmakdown that analyzes the results of our 24 models and generates manuscript figures.

There are 3 model types: AUTO_ARIMA, ES27 and ES64. 

AUTO_ARIMA is a non-ensemble model which uses the best automatic fit. 

The other 2 model types are ensembles which combine 27 or 64 ARIMA or ARIMAX models.

########################################################################################
There are 3 subfolders in our main folder: 


ERA5 data (which has the code for treating the temperature and humidity data which we later use in our models)
Hospitalization models (which has the models that use log-back transformations)  
Hospitalization models no_log (which has the models that do not use log-back transformations) 

########################################################################################
In the hospitalization models' folders we have 5 major model families each in a given folder: 

ES_ARIMA: Ensembles and single best ARIMA models. 

ES_TEMPERATURE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean state temperature as covariate.

ES_EPIWEEK: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean cases by epidemiological week for the as covariate. Value calculated for the previous 2 years.

ES_ADJACENT: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using mean hospitalizations in adjacent states as covariate.

ES_AVERAGE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using average of hospitalizations across the U.S as covariate.

########################################################################################

Each folder also includes a few data-processing files and additional datasets which we used for modeling or analysis.
