This repository has 24 ARIMA and ARIMAX models which forecasts Influenza Hospitalizations in 48 states of the U.S. 

########################################################################

Our main folder has a Rmakdown (manuscript_results) that generates images and analysis for our 24 models.

#########################################################################
There are 3 subfolders in our main folder: 

ERA5 data (which has the code for treating the temperature and humidity data which we later use in some of our models and analysis)
NHSH hospitalizations seed (which has the models that use log-back transformations)  
Hospitalization seed no_log correct (which has the models that do not use log-back transformations) 

##########################################################################
In each hospitalization models' subfolder we have 5 major model families each in a given folder: 

ES_ARIMA: Ensembles and single best ARIMA models. 

ES_TEMPERATURE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean state temperature as covariate.

ES_EPIWEEK: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean cases by epidemiological week for the as covariate. Value calculated for the previous 2 years.

ES_ADJACENT: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using mean hospitalizations in adjacent states as covariate.

ES_AVERAGE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using average of hospitalizations across the U.S as covariate.

###

Each model family include results of 3 model types: AUTO, ES27 and ES64. AUTO is a non-ensemble model which uses the best automatic fitting model. The other 2 model types are ensembles which combine 27 or 64 ARIMA or ARIMAX models. These are loaded and evaluated in the "manuscript_results.Rmd" file.

Each folder also includes a Rmakrdown which process the NHSH hospitalizations dataset and a few additional datasets which we used for modeling or analysis (SoVI, BRICs, shapefiles, temperature, humidity).
